# Production Monitoring and Alerting Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance for monitoring the SOS Tourist Doctor API in production and setting up effective alerting systems.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Application Health
- **Response Time**: Average, median, and 95th percentile response times
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of requests resulting in 4xx/5xx errors
- **Throughput**: Requests per second (RPS)
- **Uptime**: Overall application availability

#### Database Performance
- **Query Performance**: Slow query identification and optimization
- **Connection Pool**: Database connection usage and saturation
- **Storage Usage**: Database size and growth trends
- **Replication Lag**: For read replicas (if applicable)

#### System Resources
- **CPU Usage**: Per process and system-wide
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption and memory leaks
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write operations and latency
- **Network I/O**: Bandwidth usage and error rates

#### Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: New user signups over time
- **Appointment Bookings**: Daily/weekly appointment trends
- **SOS Alerts**: Emergency alert frequency and response times
- **Doctor Availability**: Active doctor count and response rates

## Monitoring Tools Setup

### Application-Level Monitoring

#### Health Check Endpoints
```javascript
// Basic health check
GET /v1/health
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

// Detailed health check
GET /v1/health/details
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": {
    "status": "connected",
    "responseTime": 45,
    "connections": {
      "active": 5,
      "idle": 10,
      "max": 20
    }
  },
  "memory": {
    "used": 134217728,
    "total": 268435456,
    "percentage": 50
  },
  "uptime": 3600,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

#### Custom Metrics Middleware
The application includes built-in metrics collection:
- Request duration tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Database query performance
- Memory usage tracking

### Infrastructure Monitoring

#### Recommended Tools
1. **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and storage
2. **Grafana** - Visualization and dashboards
3. **AlertManager** - Alert routing and management
4. **Node Exporter** - System metrics collection
5. **cAdvisor** - Container metrics (if using Docker)

#### Prometheus Configuration
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'sos-tourist-doctor-api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    scrape_interval: 10s
    metrics_path: '/v1/health/metrics'

  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Severity Levels

#### Critical Alerts (P0)
- **Application Down**: Service unavailable
- **Database Connection Failed**: Cannot connect to database
- **High Error Rate**: >5% of requests failing
- **SOS System Failure**: Emergency alerts not processing

#### Warning Alerts (P1)
- **High Response Time**: 95th percentile > 2 seconds
- **Memory Usage High**: >80% memory utilization
- **Database Slow**: Query response time > 1 second
- **Low Doctor Availability**: <3 doctors online

#### Info Alerts (P2)
- **High Traffic**: Unusual spike in requests
- **Storage Growth**: Database growing rapidly
- **Failed Logins**: Multiple authentication failures

### Alert Configuration

#### Prometheus Alert Rules
```yaml
groups:
  - name: sos-tourist-doctor
    rules:
    - alert: ServiceDown
      expr: up{job="sos-tourist-doctor-api"} == 0
      for: 1m
      labels:
        severity: critical
      annotations:
        summary: "SOS Tourist Doctor API is down"
        description: "The API has been down for more than 1 minute"

    - alert: HighErrorRate
      expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m]) * 100 > 5
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: critical
      annotations:
        summary: "High error rate detected"
        description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}%"

    - alert: SlowResponseTime
      expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 2
      for: 10m
      labels:
        severity: warning
      annotations:
