## Environment Variables Checklist

Ensure the following environment variables are properly set in production:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| NODE_ENV | Environment (production) | Yes |
| PORT | Port to run the application on | Yes |
| JWT_SECRET | Secret for JWT token signing | Yes |
| JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES | JWT access token expiration | Yes |
| JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS | JWT refresh token expiration | Yes |
| SUPABASE_URL | Supabase project URL | Yes |
| SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY | Supabase service role key | Yes |
| SUPABASE_ANON_KEY | Supabase anonymous key | Yes |
| TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID | Twilio account SID | Yes |
| TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN | Twilio auth token | Yes |
| EMAIL_HOST | SMTP host for email service | Yes |
| EMAIL_PORT | SMTP port | Yes |
| EMAIL_USERNAME | SMTP username | Yes |
| EMAIL_PASSWORD | SMTP password | Yes |

## Health Check Endpoints

The following endpoints should be monitored:

1. `GET /v1/health` - Basic health check
2. `GET /v1/health/details` - Detailed health information
3. `GET /v1/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
4. `GET /v1/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
5. `GET /v1/health/database` - Database health check
6. `GET /v1/health/metrics` - Application metrics

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance benchmarks:

- Response time for API endpoints: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database query time: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Authentication endpoint response time: < 500ms
- Memory usage: < 1GB per instance
- CPU usage: < 70% under normal load

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Process
1. Identify the problematic deployment
2. Revert to the previous stable version
3. Validate functionality after rollback
4. Notify stakeholders

### Scaling Process
1. Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
2. Add additional instances if needed
3. Scale database if required
4. Monitor performance after scaling

### Incident Response
1. Identify the issue through monitoring alerts
2. Assess the impact
3. Notify the team
4. Implement mitigation
5. Document the incident
6. Implement preventive measures
